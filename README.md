# SAODesktopNotesSharp

Turn your desktop wallpaper into a place to take quick notes!

I use this program to manage reminders / general TODOs, using the full 1920x1080 canvas of my desktop instead of squishing myself to Sticky Notes.

Each note has a timestamp with its contents. The program can be changed in the source code of course.

## Files

`SAODesktopNotesSharp.exe` will show a prompt that can be used to add, remove, edit, and rearrange notes. This will minimise to the tray when closed.

`Desktop Notes.xml` stores the contents of the notes between sessions.

`Desktop Notes.png` is the wallpaper that is applied.
